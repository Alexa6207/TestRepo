# AxBoard
Raspberry Pi-based, sound board that loads and plays samples, triggered by various GPIO and keyboard signals.


## Purpose
This was originally intended as a way to trigger keyboard/synth samples using a keypad stuck on a guitar, and/or via a floor box with multiple stomp switches - i.e. An ergonomically practical solution for a guitar player to trigger samples while also simultaneously playing guitar.  It is probably adaptable to many other uses.

## Hardware
The AxBoard uses some of the following hardware for triggering samples:
* Adafruit trellis
* Regular or wireless keyboard

The AxBoard uses some of the following hardware for displaying information:
* PiPlate 2x2 LCD
* iUniker 2.2 inch Screen with CNC Case

## Software libraries/dependencies
* Pygame
* Adafruit Trellis Library
