# AxBoard
Raspberry Pi-based, sound board that loads and plays samples, triggered by various GPIO and keyboard signals.


## Purpose
This was originally intended as a way to trigger keyboard/synth samples using a keypad stuck on a guitar, and/or via a floor box with multiple stomp switches - i.e. An ergonomically practical solution for a guitar player to trigger samples while also simultaneously playing guitar.  It is probably adaptable to many other uses.

## Hardware
The AxBoard uses the following hardware:
Adafruit trellis
PiPlate 2x2 LCD

## Software libraries/dependencies
Pygame
Adafruit Trellis Library
